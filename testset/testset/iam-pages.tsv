now so much nobler a figure than former historians
led us to believe. Laud was enthusiastically hated
by Calvinists and Puritans, and the sentiment was
mutual. But Laud was no Romanizer. One of his
first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
the Jesuit, Fisher. But anyone who was friendly
with James and Charles, the Puritans argued,
was necessarily a menace."

to the Commonwealth through the
strength we would gain in the Common
Market than by isolation. He paid

prosperity tomorrow. BERTRAND RUSSELL,
the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban-
the-Bomb crusade, has devoted following.
Thousands march with him - and sit with him
too. It is said by some that he is a saint; by
others that he is a prophet. He is, in fact, a
philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
who has been spectacularly wrong on the great
issues of our time."

baker in the House in those early

but now, with plenty of political
ammunition given him by the Gov-
ernment in recent sessions, he is
leading the Opposition with skill and
assurance and is a match for the
Prime Minister across the floor."

Then comes engineering, followed by iron and steel.
Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
tremendous upsurge in investment. It reports that new
factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
up on 1960. Britain's business men are right to back
their faith with cash."

by an old man. Here it is a young homo-
sexual, estranged from women but yet moved

her in her hour of need. He shares her room

manoeuvring, and what we should call

Third Reich with the sinking of the great ocean liner,
and paid for his audacity with his life."
"a01-038.png"	"Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian
parties had refused to attend the talks
because Sir Roy had found messages
sent from the Government were "" unsatisfac-
tory. "" African delegates to the talks yester-
day called on Mr. Macmillan to cease his
negotiations with Sir Roy's representative,
Mr. Julius Greenfield. He was at Che-

cheered for a full minute - and even his
bitterest opponents on defence joined in.
Mr. Powell devoted half his speech to giving
details of plans for improving the hospital
service, on which indeed the Government is
making progress. His basic defence of the
Health Service cuts was that "" even after
the proposed changes the net cost of the
service to the Exchequer will have increased
over three years by 20 per cent."
"a01-072u.png"	"These support costs are a big drain on
America's dollar reserves. Dr. Adenauer's
answer is the once-and-for-all cash

rejection of it is a painful blow to the
West German Government. It will now have
to pay more - and increase taxation to do
so - or run the obvious # risks in upsetting
the new American administration."

Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to

"d01-104.png"	"This last objection might have had some weight in
ecclesiastical circles. In his Natural History, 13. 11-12,
the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making.
As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79, his
information is contemporaneous with the New Testament.
The other form of book was the codex. In this the

rise in taxation - something no one is prepared
to contemplate in an election year."

to the Treasury, said yesterday that the
Government does not like retrospective legislation.
He went on to describe the kind of
people the Chancellor hopes to tax. These

and property dealers who form a chain of
companies and put one property deal through
each."

over West Germany's cash offer to help
