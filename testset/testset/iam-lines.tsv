a01-007-00.png	Since 1958 , 13 Labour life Peers and
a01-007-01.png	Peeresses have been created . Most Labour
a01-007-02.png	sentiment would # still favour the abolition
a01-007-03.png	of the House of Lords , but while it remains
a01-007-04.png	Labour has to have an adequate number of
a01-007-05.png	members . THE two rival African Nationalist
a01-007-06.png	Parties of Northern Rhodesia have agreed to
a01-007-07.png	get together to face the challenge from Sir
a01-007-08.png	Roy Welensky , the Federal Premier .
a01-014-00.png	Sir Roy's United Federal Party is boycotting
a01-014-01.png	the London talks on the Protectorate's
a01-014-02.png	future . Said Mr. Nkumbula last night :
a01-014-03.png	""" We want to discuss what to do if the"
a01-014-04.png	British Government gives in to Sir Roy and
a01-014-05.png	the talks fall through . There are bound
a01-014-06.png	"to be demonstrations . "" Yesterday Sir Roy's"
a01-014-07.png	chief aide , Mr. Julius Greenfield , telephoned
a01-014-08.png	his chief a report on his talks with
a01-014-09.png	Mr. Macmillan at Chequers .
a01-020-00.png	Mr. Macleod went on with the conference at
a01-020-01.png	Lancaster House despite the crisis which had
a01-020-02.png	blown up . He has now revealed his full plans
a01-020-03.png	to the Africans and Liberals attending . These
a01-020-04.png	plans do not give the Africans the overall
a01-020-05.png	majority they are seeking . African delegates
a01-020-06.png	are studying them today . The conference
a01-020-07.png	will meet to discuss the function of a
a01-020-08.png	proposed House of Chiefs .
a01-038-00.png	Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian
a01-038-01.png	parties had refused to attend the talks
a01-038-02.png	because Sir Roy had found messages
a01-038-03.png	"sent from the Government were "" unsatisfac-"
a01-038-04.png	"tory . "" African delegates to the talks yester-"
a01-038-05.png	day called on Mr. Macmillan to cease his
a01-038-06.png	negotiations with Sir Roy's representative ,
a01-038-07.png	Mr. Julius Greenfield . He was at Che-
a01-038-08.png	quers last week-end . They said they
a01-038-09.png	"regarded with "" growing anger "" the "" gross"
a01-038-10.png	"and unconstitutional "" interference by"
a01-038-11.png	Sir Roy's Federal Government in the
a01-058-00.png	PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough
a01-058-01.png	over West Germany's cash offer to help
a01-058-02.png	America's balance of payments position .
a01-058-03.png	He said bluntly in Washington yester-
a01-058-04.png	day that the offer - 357million - was
a01-058-05.png	not good enough . And he indicated
a01-058-06.png	that his Government would try to get
a01-058-07.png	Germany to pay more . He did not
a01-058-08.png	mention personal talks with Dr.
a01-058-09.png	Adenauer , the West German Chancellor .
a01-063-00.png	"But he said discussions "" on a higher"
a01-063-01.png	"level than in the past "" might be"
a01-063-02.png	useful . The President will probably
a01-063-03.png	discuss the problem with Dr. Brentano ,
a01-063-04.png	the West German Foreign Minister , who is
a01-063-05.png	due in Washington next week . A big
a01-063-06.png	"slice of Germany's "" aid "" # is the early"
a01-063-07.png	payment of a 210million debt to America .
a01-063-08.png	United States officials quickly point out
a01-063-09.png	that this is money due to America
a01-087-00.png	Mr. Brown , passionate and warm-hearted , led
a01-087-01.png	Labour's attack on the higher health
a01-087-02.png	charges . Mr. Powell , white-faced and outwardly
a01-087-03.png	unemotional , replied with a statistical state-
a01-087-04.png	ment - and ended by inciting Labour M Ps
a01-087-05.png	to angry uproar . One dealt with the human
a01-087-06.png	issue behind the Health Service ; the other
a01-087-07.png	tried to show that the balance-sheet must
a01-107-00.png	We believe that a comprehensive medical service , free to the patient
a01-107-01.png	at the point of need and with one standard for all sick
a01-107-02.png	"people , is good and attainable . "" We remain for it . But the Tories"
a01-107-03.png	"never were . "" Interrupted by angry Tories , Mr. Brown retorted :"
a01-107-04.png	""" The jackals bay when there is nothing better they can do . """
a01-117-00.png	In fact , the Tories made it worse now for the sick and
a01-117-01.png	needy than Labour had to make it in 1950 . And
a01-117-02.png	as a percentage of social service expenditure ,
a01-117-03.png	health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent.
a01-117-04.png	Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the
a01-117-05.png	unsmiling Mr. Powell . He demanded that instead
a01-117-06.png	of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should
a01-117-07.png	take ruthless action against the drug making
a01-117-08.png	industry , whose profits had risen by up to 400
a01-117-09.png	per cent. in the last eight years .
a01-128-00.png	When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps cheered for
a01-128-01.png	a full minute - and even his bitterest opponents
a01-128-02.png	on defence joined in . Mr. Powell devoted half his speech
a01-128-03.png	to giving details of plans for improving the hospital service ,
a01-128-04.png	on which indeed the Government is making progress .
a01-128-05.png	His basic defence of the Health Service cuts was that
a01-128-06.png	""" even after the proposed changes the net cost of the"
a01-128-07.png	service to the Exchequer will have increased over
a02-020-00.png	Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a
a02-020-01.png	meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville , French
a02-020-02.png	Foreign Minister , and Mr. Heath . MR. Selwyn Lloyd -
a02-020-03.png	a man with troubles enough back home - seems
a02-020-04.png	fated to fly into trouble abroad . Last year it was
a02-020-05.png	the riots in Istanbul , which enlivened the NATO
a02-024-00.png	Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in
a02-024-01.png	Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com-
a02-024-02.png	monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the
a02-024-03.png	first to be held in Africa . Only a few hours af-
a02-024-04.png	ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed
a02-024-05.png	at Accra this morning , hundreds of shop assistants
a02-024-06.png	demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway
a02-032-00.png	But in his absence his chief lieutenants have
a02-032-01.png	not let him down . The strong arm of authority has
a02-032-02.png	been raised against the strikers and is now beginning
a02-032-03.png	"to tell . Today's Ghanaian Times ( motto : "" The welfare"
a02-032-04.png	"of the people is the supreme law "" ) reports : "" The"
a02-032-05.png	Government has been urged to take immediate ac-

a02-050-03.png	Commonwealth was an occasion worthy of his presence .
a02-050-04.png	After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this
a02-050-05.png	year the Economic Consultative Council should meet
a02-057-00.png	It alleged : Phones were being tapped and
a02-057-01.png	going out of action ; Police were visiting
a02-057-02.png	"people "" on no pretext whatsoever , except"
a02-057-03.png	"to pass the time of day "" ; Supporters had"
a02-057-04.png	been warned - one that his connection
a02-057-05.png	with the committee was going too far ; another
a02-057-06.png	that anti-apartheid agitation was
a02-057-07.png	all right , but support for the committee
a02-072-00.png	""" He is not going to agree to be bound over . That will"
a02-072-01.png	probably mean jail and , though frail , he is very fit and
a02-072-02.png	will take the rigours of prison in his stride . He
a02-072-03.png	"hopes to be allowed to do some writing . "" Back at"
a02-072-04.png	the Press conference , Mr. Clark said two committee
a02-072-05.png	"members tried a "" plant "" call on suspect phone . They"
a02-072-06.png	discussed a sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. - none
a02-072-07.png	was planned but police turned up .
a03-023-00.png	This emphasis on the legality of the former
a03-023-01.png	Government suggests that all is not well
a03-023-02.png	with the political and military leadership
a03-023-03.png	of the pro-communists . Most of the
a03-023-04.png	province of Xieng Khouang and the
a03-023-05.png	tactically useful Plain of Jars , however ,
a03-023-06.png	appear still to be firmly in their hands .
a03-023-07.png	The Government has claimed the
a03-023-08.png	recapture of Vang Vieng , the pro-
a03-023-09.png	communists' former base 60 miles
a03-023-10.png	north of Vientiane , but this claim
a03-054-00.png	Everything is being done to promote
a03-054-01.png	a new image . Certainly , he is now a
a03-054-02.png	much lessly trounced by Mr. Diefen-
a03-054-03.png	baker in the House in those early
a03-054-04.png	days . It has been a hard road back
a03-054-05.png	but now , with plenty of political
a03-054-06.png	ammunition given him by the Gov-
a03-054-07.png	ernment in recent sessions , he is
a03-054-08.png	leading the Opposition with skill and
a03-054-09.png	assurance and is a match for the
a03-054-10.png	Prime Minister across the floor .
a03-063-01.png	Mr. Thorneycroft , the Minister of Aviation , who arrives in
a03-063-02.png	Bonn tomorrow for talks with the Federal Government on a
a03-063-03.png	European space satellite project , will find the Germans
a03-063-04.png	interested in the principle of space research , but rather
a03-063-05.png	sceptical about British plans for organizing it .
a03-063-06.png	Stated more bluntly , they are still unconvinced that
a03-063-07.png	this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to
a03-063-08.png	salve Blue Streak , which was abandoned last summer
a03-063-09.png	as a military project ; or that the European space satellite
a03-063-10.png	is indeed to be purely scientific in character .
a03-066-00.png	Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to
a03-066-01.png	remove these doubts , and to persuade the
a03-066-02.png	Federal Government that the financial burden
a03-066-03.png	involved is really worth while , at a time when
a03-066-04.png	any increase in budgetary commitments
a03-066-05.png	would almost certainly involve a corresponding
a03-066-06.png	rise in taxation - something no one is prepared
a03-066-07.png	to contemplate in an election year .
a04-003-00.png	It arose during talks following
a04-003-01.png	President Kennedy's report to the British
a04-003-02.png	Prime Minister of the outcome of his recent
a04-003-03.png	visit to Paris . There General de Gaulle had made
a04-003-04.png	clear that he would accept Britain into the
a04-003-05.png	Common Market only if there were no conditions
a04-003-06.png	laid down to meet the Commonwealth
a04-003-07.png	and other reservations .
a04-010-00.png	An attempt to get more information about the
a04-010-01.png	Admiralty House meeting will be made in the
a04-010-02.png	House of Commons this afternoon . Labour M.P.s already
a04-010-03.png	have many questions to the Prime Minister asking
a04-010-04.png	for a statement . President Kennedy flew from London
a04-010-05.png	Airport last night to arrive in Washington this
a04-010-06.png	morning . He is to make a 30-minute nation-wide
a04-010-07.png	broadcast and television report on his
a04-010-08.png	talks with Mr. Krushchov this evening .
a04-027-00.png	From Nato headquarters Mr. Rusk went to see President de Gaulle
a04-027-01.png	and informed him of the Vienna outcome . Last night Mr. Rusk arrived
a04-027-02.png	in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to
a04-027-03.png	fly home with the President . In DUESSELDORF , Chancellor Adenauer
a04-027-04.png	"said the Vienna talks "" might be the beginning of a slight improvement , """
a04-027-05.png	but no big changes should be expected in the political situation .
a04-059-00.png	The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
a04-059-01.png	in the Holy Loch , only 30 miles from Glasgow , a
a04-059-02.png	city with two million people . It should be sited
a04-059-03.png	in a more remote area . Mr. Gaitskell added that
a04-059-04.png	the Scarborough conference decisions did not , in his
a04-059-05.png	view , truly reflect the opinions of the majority
a04-059-06.png	of party members and still less the party's
a04-099-00.png	""" Such retaliation might , and probably would ,"
a04-099-01.png	destroy the whole population of Britain in
a04-099-02.png	"the course of , at the most , an hour "" without"
a04-099-03.png	provoking American retaliation . Earl Russell
a04-099-04.png	"believes : "" It is very questionable whether"
a04-099-05.png	British membership of Nato and British
a04-099-06.png	permission of American bases on our territory
a04-099-07.png	add anything to the strength of America ,
a04-099-08.png	while , on the contrary , they impose upon
a04-099-09.png	America an onerous obligation which it
a04-099-10.png	"may prove impossible to fulfil . """
a05-022-00.png	It is thought this would be the minimum
a05-022-01.png	necessary for the extended training modern
a05-022-02.png	arms require and to enable each man to
a05-022-03.png	serve at least a year overseas . There is
a05-022-04.png	no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
a05-022-05.png	is at odds with the Service chiefs over
a05-022-06.png	the decision to dispense with National
a05-022-07.png	Service , or over any other aspect of
a05-058-00.png	""" We must not be rattled into surrender ,"
a05-058-01.png	but we must not - and I am not - be
a05-058-02.png	"afraid of negotiation . "" Mr. Godber ,"
a05-058-03.png	Minister of State , Foreign Office , said
a05-058-04.png	earlier that the Government had asked
a05-058-05.png	the Medical Research Council to reassess
a05-058-06.png	the fall-out position in view of the Russian
a05-058-07.png	tests . The Council's findings would be
a05-084-00.png	The Russians now realised its seriousness . The
a05-084-01.png	French doubts were more about procedure
a05-084-02.png	than about substance . The Prime Minister's
a05-084-03.png	attitude of studied calm brought down the
a05-084-04.png	temperature of the debate , which never
a05-084-05.png	at any time rose to fever pitch , to a
a05-084-06.png	remarkable degree of sub-normality .
a05-084-07.png	Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl
a05-084-08.png	of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening
a05-084-09.png	in the Peers' Gallery .
a06-004-00.png	Sir Edward Boyle , Financial Secretary
a06-004-01.png	to the Treasury , said yesterday that the
a06-004-02.png	Government does not like retrospective legislation .
a06-004-03.png	He went on to describe the kind of
a06-004-04.png	people the Chancellor hopes to tax . These
a06-004-05.png	are people buying and selling shares within
a06-004-06.png	"a short period , those "" stagging "" on a new issue"
a06-004-07.png	and property dealers who form a chain of
a06-004-08.png	companies and put one property deal through

a06-075-01.png	Majesty's Government have come to the

a06-095-02.png	strength we would gain in the Common

a06-128-06.png	MR. KRUSCHEV raises the bogy of
a06-128-07.png	German militarism in his replies to
a06-128-08.png	the West on Berlin . And he repeats
a06-128-09.png	"that the problem "" must be solved"
a06-141-00.png	BRITAIN - One cannot but wonder at British bases being
a06-141-01.png	put at the disposal of those very militarists who razed
a06-141-02.png	Coventry and barbarously bombed London and other British
a06-141-03.png	cities . FRANCE - One can hardly conceive the French are
a06-141-04.png	not alarmed ... . Next door , in West Germany , before everyone's
a06-141-05.png	eyes there has sprung up a regular army led by former Nazi
b01-033-00.png	But the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by
b01-033-01.png	their visit . The warmth of their welcome in India and
b01-033-02.png	Pakistan are happy memories . WEST GERMANY - followed
b01-033-03.png	yesterday by the Dutch - has made the gesture
b01-033-04.png	of a good neighbour . She has put up the value
b01-122-00.png	It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
b01-122-01.png	woerd in his nightmare world . It is this that
b01-122-02.png	makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-
b01-122-03.png	fluenced to change course . The Archbishop of
b01-122-04.png	Capetown , Dr. Joost de Blank , has pleaded that
b01-122-05.png	South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
b01-122-06.png	Commonwealth . Otherwise , he says , those inside the
b01-122-07.png	country who still oppose apartheid will be
b01-122-08.png	left even more isolated and alone .
b01-127-00.png	The views of the Archbishop , who has
b01-127-01.png	maintained an unflinching witness to what
b01-127-02.png	Christianity really means , must carry weight . But
b01-127-03.png	what , in fact , can the other Commonwealth countries
b01-127-04.png	do to bring support and comfort to this gallant
b01-127-05.png	minority ? THERE is no evidence that the
b01-127-06.png	policy of appeasement has modified the
b01-127-07.png	actions of the Nationalists . On the contrary ,
b01-127-08.png	apartheid is being applied ever more
b02-035-00.png	On this reading what Mr. Gollancz calls
b02-035-01.png	manoeuvring , and what we should call
b02-035-02.png	cool-headed and inventive negotiation , is
b02-035-03.png	a means not to destruction but to safety .
b02-035-04.png	The Government's pompous little statement
b02-035-05.png	on Northern Rhodesia does not say much ,
b02-035-06.png	but it says what is necessary - that
b02-035-07.png	the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is
b02-035-08.png	open to revision . This is news , however
b02-035-09.png	much the Government tries to disguise
b02-035-10.png	it by saying that the revision would be
b03-087-00.png	The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the
b03-087-01.png	agreement is signed . To this there will be some opposition . The Bill is
b03-087-02.png	short and modest in scope , and it is doubtful whether the other Private
b03-087-03.png	Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps . This fact may give

b04-060-00.png	It is equally certain that the British Government
b04-060-01.png	will welcome them . How splendid it would be if , just
b04-060-02.png	for once , the Government were to voice the real feelings of
b04-060-03.png	the British people . And tell Makarios they are not
b04-060-04.png	prepared to accept him on such terms . GOOD cheer

b04-096-00.png	Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the
b04-096-01.png	national income was spent on social services . The
b04-096-02.png	present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many
b04-096-03.png	worthwhile targets for the Opposition . What a pity
b04-096-04.png	to aim at the wrong one ! MRS. MARCIA POWER ,
b04-096-05.png	whose husband made her clean his uniform , wins

b04-107-00.png	HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly
b04-107-01.png	in Rhodesia ! Eighteen months ago this territory
b04-107-02.png	was peaceful , orderly , and thriving . Africans within the
b04-107-03.png	Federal Government were getting valuable experience in
b04-107-04.png	administration . Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial
b04-107-05.png	Secretary . Suddenly everything changed . Timetables were
b04-107-06.png	scrapped . The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was
b04-107-07.png	rushed out to Rhodesia . Overnight , minor African
b04-107-08.png	politicians were inflated into international figures .
b04-128-00.png	Top of the table , at the moment , is the chemical industry .
b04-128-01.png	Then comes engineering , followed by iron and steel .
b04-128-02.png	Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
b04-128-03.png	tremendous upsurge in investment . It reports that new
b04-128-04.png	factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
b04-128-05.png	up on 1960 . Britain's business men are right to back
b04-134-00.png	For expansion today means still greater
b04-134-01.png	prosperity tomorrow . BERTRAND RUSSELL ,
b04-134-02.png	the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban-
b04-134-03.png	the-Bomb crusade , has devoted following .
b04-134-04.png	Thousands march with him - and sit with him
b04-134-05.png	too . It is said by some that he is a saint ; by
b04-134-06.png	others that he is a prophet . He is , in fact , a
b04-134-07.png	philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
b04-134-08.png	who has been spectacularly wrong on the great
b05-038-00.png	Hence the hostility to automation and
b05-038-01.png	the stop-watch manufacturing methods that
b05-038-02.png	have # led to restrictive practices . Now a new
b05-038-03.png	threat to those who toil and spin has been
b05-038-04.png	developed by a firm specialising in electronics
b05-038-05.png	in Los Angeles . They have developed a new
b05-038-06.png	system whereby completely untrained workers
b05-038-07.png	can be taught their trade by means of tape

b05-058-01.png	EICHMANN continues # to reveal the extraordinary divisions of the
b05-058-02.png	German mind . Not content with arguing that he was only an
b05-058-03.png	efficient cog in the machine , he now claims that part of the
b05-058-04.png	endless massacre that led to the death of six million Jews was
b05-067-00.png	""" I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I"
b05-067-01.png	"could despite my low rank . "" Eichmann is on dangerous ground"
b05-067-02.png	when he pleads that he was only a small unit on the base
b05-067-03.png	of the triangle that led to Hitler , Himmler , Hess and Goering
b05-067-04.png	at the apex . In examination he betrayed an expert and
b05-067-05.png	intimate knowledge of every link in the chain of command that
b05-083-00.png	In no other conquered country , not even
b05-083-01.png	Poland , had the Germans begun with such a
b05-083-02.png	drastic step . There is no doubt that the compatriots
b05-083-03.png	of Eichmann would have been as good as their
b05-083-04.png	evil word . THE Inland Revenue people have a
b05-083-05.png	thankless task . But they do not make
b05-083-06.png	themselves less disliked by their attitude
b05-083-07.png	to their customers - who incidentally
b05-083-08.png	pay their salaries .
b06-027-00.png	Last month West Germany was
b06-027-01.png	reported to be halfway toward

b06-027-04.png	and stronger . Now this target which

b06-056-01.png	Scarborough decisions , while # scratching
b06-056-02.png	around frantically to overturn them next
b06-056-03.png	time . Confusion of the original issue
b06-056-04.png	by misrepresentation of the decisions ,
b06-056-05.png	the introduction of a pseudo third way
b06-056-06.png	and the call for party unity - in effect ,
b06-056-07.png	a demand that the movement unite
b06-056-08.png	with the Gaitskellites on their policy
b06-056-09.png	and no other seems to have done the
b06-056-10.png	trick of moving a number of unions
b06-068-00.png	All recent events show how correct the
b06-068-01.png	Scarborough decisions were . The Kennedy
b06-068-02.png	Administration's sharpened policies , the
b06-068-03.png	speeded-up drive to improve West
b06-068-04.png	Germany's armament , the new attempt
b06-068-05.png	to rush Britain into the European Common
b06-068-06.png	Market , and the kite-flying on Spain
b06-068-07.png	present a whole new proof that to abandon
b06-068-08.png	Scarborough is to expose Britain and her
b06-068-09.png	working class to sharp new dangers - that
b06-068-10.png	Gaitskellism is bankrupt .
b06-075-00.png	At the same time that unity cannot be
b06-075-01.png	established on a false basis , or by creating
b06-075-02.png	further confusion within the movement . Unity
b06-075-03.png	will never be established on the basis of leaders
b06-075-04.png	being a law unto themselves and opposing
b06-075-05.png	conference decisions when it suits their own
b06-075-06.png	convenience . Unity can never be established by
b06-075-07.png	any formula uniting those who oppose German
b06-075-08.png	troops being trained on British soil and Polaris ,
b06-075-09.png	and those who are for this policy - which is the
b06-075-10.png	same as that of the Tory Government .
b06-093-00.png	This should strengthen the campaign to
b06-093-01.png	end the manufacture and use of
b06-093-02.png	nuclear weapons in Britain . Britain then
b06-093-03.png	could play a leading and independent
b06-093-04.png	role for an international agreement to ban
b06-093-05.png	all nuclear strategy and weapons of mass
b06-093-06.png	destruction , and lay the basis for real
b06-093-07.png	peace and progress . WHEN all the
b06-093-08.png	ballyhoo about Commonwealth Training
b06-093-09.png	Week subsides it is doubtful whether more
b06-093-10.png	than a handful of new apprenticeships
b06-110-00.png	But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people
b06-110-01.png	prefer unskilled jobs . Countless numbers who want training
b06-110-02.png	are denied it . One area electricity board in 1958
b06-110-03.png	offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450
b06-110-04.png	applications , of whom 100 were considered suitable by
b06-110-05.png	the board . There were only 17 vacancies for the 58
b06-110-06.png	boys who passed the Admiralty exams for Rosyth
c01-009-00.png	The production by Bill Duncalf
c01-009-01.png	compressed a long and sometimes rambling
c01-009-02.png	story into a concentrated comprehensive

c01-009-05.png	"unambiguously "" contemporary "" work to be"
c01-009-06.png	admitted to the Glyndebourne canon . By no
c01-009-07.png	means a masterpiece , it is in many respects
c01-009-08.png	a representative modern work and the composer
c01-009-09.png	is a highly skilled manipulator of contemporary
c01-009-10.png	idioms , with a strong sense of words and situation .
c02-000-00.png	AFTER ten days of intermittent , near fatal
c02-000-01.png	ennui , the eleventh Berlin International
c02-000-02.png	Film Festival was suddenly jolted back to
c02-000-03.png	life by two extraordinary films , Bernhard
c02-000-04.png	"Wicki's "" Das Wunder des Malachias "" ( "" The"
c02-000-05.png	"Miracle of Father Malachias "" ) and Michael-"

c02-007-01.png	only in Germany but also in Africa and
c02-007-02.png	America . An exhibition of these works which
c02-007-03.png	is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most im-

c03-007-01.png	a town in the industrial North of England
c03-007-02.png	and has made it live . The shabby streets
c03-007-03.png	and wet pavements , the school play-grounds ,

c03-007-07.png	are seen as an integral part of the story .
c04-004-00.png	I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the
c04-004-01.png	old , star-studded West End than he will ever feel in
c04-004-02.png	Hollywood . His American bosses , 20th-Century Fox , have
c04-004-03.png	recently given Frankie the full , razzamataz , red-carpet
c04-004-04.png	treatment . But they haven't done a thing for his film
c04-004-05.png	career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not
c04-004-06.png	doing better here , before the platinum-plated Hollywood
c04-004-07.png	carrot was dangled before his nose .
c04-017-00.png	But 6,000 miles seems a heck of a way to go
c04-017-01.png	for a new hit song . He might be well advised to
c04-017-02.png	think hard and long before his next jump into the
c04-017-04.png	VERDICT : Vaughan should have by-passed this approach .
c04-017-05.png	RONALD Lewis has just left for his first taste of the

c06-103-00.png	THE Marriage-Go-Round ( Carlton )
c06-103-01.png	is also a comedy of manners ,
c06-103-02.png	but fun-films toting an X

c06-103-07.png	verbal variety and not the visual

c06-103-09.png	that of the entry of a gladiator
c06-111-00.png	This sort of situation calls for some subtle ,
c06-111-01.png	slightly sardonic handling . It doesn't get it . But
c06-111-02.png	The Marriage-Go-Round is not entirely a waste of
c06-111-03.png	time . I learned from it that in the Institutes of Advanced
c06-111-04.png	Studies attached to some American universities
c06-111-05.png	the subject Social Psychology used to be called
c06-111-06.png	Home-making and is now known as Domestic
c06-128-00.png	ON a March evening in 1932 in the New
c06-128-01.png	Jersey family household the nursemaid
c06-128-02.png	tiptoed into the baby's room to see that
c06-128-03.png	20-month-old Charles Jun. was sleeping .
c06-128-04.png	Bending over the cot , she suddenly realised
c06-128-05.png	that there was no sound of breathing .
c06-128-06.png	She thrust out her hand - and felt
c06-128-07.png	emptiness . A FEW minutes later the father
c06-128-08.png	gripping a loaded rifle , told his wife :
d01-024-00.png	Most of those who expound a theory of textual
d01-024-01.png	dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
d01-024-02.png	written entirely by one author before the
d01-024-03.png	disturbance took place but a few leave it open
d01-024-04.png	to suppose that the original book had been
d01-024-05.png	revised even before the upheaval . The ingenuity
d01-024-06.png	of the theories is impressive and is the best
d01-104-00.png	This last objection might have had some weight in
d01-104-01.png	ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,
d01-104-02.png	the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
d01-104-03.png	As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
d01-104-04.png	overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his
d01-104-05.png	information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
d01-104-06.png	The other form of book was the codex . In this the
d01-104-07.png	sheets were bound together down one edge much as
d04-012-00.png	The word Shamir was used as a
d04-012-01.png	personal name ( Git. 68a ) . The Hebrew
d04-012-02.png	"word "" SHAMIR "" means guarded or preser-"
d04-012-03.png	ved . Therefore , the real man , who
d04-012-04.png	regards himself as insignificant , as the
d04-012-05.png	"prayer says : "" What am I ? A worm "" , he"
d04-012-06.png	is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
d04-012-07.png	the Shmah , loves the Lord God with
d04-012-08.png	all his heart , and with all his soul and
d04-012-09.png	with all his might and studies the

d04-086-01.png	just as there is a message sealed in the four emblems which
d04-086-02.png	"are used on Passover , to depict the "" time of our freedom "" ."
d04-086-03.png	And they are ( 1 ) Matzo ; ( 2 ) Bitter Herbs ; ( 3 ) Salt-water and
d04-086-04.png	Charauses ( a kind of fruit mixture in likeness of the
d04-086-05.png	appearance of mortar ) ; and ( 4 ) an attitude to lean
d04-096-00.png	Self-control gives us : Freedom to worship God . ( 3 ) Salt Water and Charauses :
d04-096-01.png	the salt-water at the Seder-Table represents the Covenant of the Torah
d04-096-02.png	( MELACH BRITH ELOHECHO in Hebrew , Salt is the covenant of 1thy God ,
d04-096-03.png	Levit. 2 , 13 . ) Salt preserves and we should have this salt in
d04-096-04.png	ourselves and have peace with one-another . And the sweet
d04-096-05.png	"Mortar ( the CHARAUSES in Hebrew ) that binds all the "" hard-"
d04-096-06.png	"facts "" together and explains them , represents the Oral"
d05-008-00.png	The new century opened with James 1 ascending
d05-008-01.png	the throne . He was quite prepared to be
d05-008-02.png	tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
d05-008-03.png	spoiled that . The Puritans had high hopes , for
d05-008-04.png	James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland ,
d05-008-05.png	but those hopes were dashed . True , a new Prayer
d05-008-06.png	Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
d05-008-07.png	derived little comfort from it .
d05-030-00.png	Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud ,
d05-030-01.png	now so much nobler a figure than former historians
d05-030-02.png	led us to believe . Laud was enthusiastically hated
d05-030-03.png	by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was
d05-030-04.png	mutual . But Laud was no Romanizer . One of his
d05-030-05.png	first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
d05-030-06.png	the Jesuit , Fisher . But anyone who was friendly
d05-030-07.png	with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,
d05-030-08.png	was necessarily a menace .
d06-000-00.png	In the first place it is not a great deal
d06-000-01.png	of use telling even children , as I have
d06-000-02.png	already suggested , not to be silly or
d06-000-03.png	to pull themselves together . Far better
d06-000-04.png	to help them to face whatever it is that
d06-000-05.png	is worrying them , to find the original
d06-000-06.png	cause and then deal with it ; show it
d06-000-07.png	up either for the sham it is - and many
d06-000-08.png	fears are based upon completely
d06-000-09.png	irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
d06-011-00.png	Because situations which may contain
d06-011-01.png	all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,
d06-011-02.png	it is a good idea to condition a child
d06-011-03.png	to some extent against it . To keep a child
d06-011-04.png	of twelve or thirteen under the
d06-011-05.png	impression that nothing nasty ever
d06-011-06.png	happens is not merely dishonest , it
d06-011-07.png	is unwise . As I shall suggest in a
d06-011-08.png	later chapter there are some situations
d06-011-09.png	which occur less frequently than
d06-025-00.png	... Today A wonderful thought In the
d06-025-01.png	dawn was given ... And the thought
d06-025-02.png	Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in
d06-025-03.png	my hand ; That my hand is big Big ,
d06-025-04.png	Because of the plan That God , Who
d06-025-05.png	dwells in my hand , Knows this
d06-025-06.png	secret plan , Of the things He will
d06-025-07.png	do for the world Using my hand .
d06-030-00.png	Amen . MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
d06-030-01.png	purely physical thing . The cure for which is sleep . This is only
d06-030-02.png	partly true . Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
d06-030-03.png	amount of rest seems to make any difference . Sleep , to be
d06-030-04.png	effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes
d06-072-00.png	In many cases , their homes know little of
d06-072-01.png	their place of work and their associates at
d06-072-02.png	the office or works wonder what they
d06-072-03.png	are possibly like in the surroundings of their
d06-072-04.png	homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead
d06-072-05.png	a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
d06-072-06.png	planning to do so or in fact being conscious
d06-072-07.png	of what is going on . It is easier to live life in
d06-072-08.png	compartments but over the years it builds up ,
d06-072-09.png	and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
d06-072-10.png	need to be handled correctly .
