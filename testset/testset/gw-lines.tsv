275-02.jpg	who is to go up to Fort Cumberland. You are to see
275-03.jpg	that the men of the Virginia Regiment are exer-
275-04.jpg	cised as often every day as the duty will admit;
275-05.jpg	and that they are practised also in shooting at Tar-
275-06.jpg	gets; and if there are any who are remarkably
275-07.jpg	awkward, particular pains must be taken with
275-08.jpg	them. You must observe on your march good
275-09.jpg	order and discipline, and see that no irregu-
275-10.jpg	larities happen; and that the men are not
275-11.jpg	allowed to pillage the Country, which was very
275-12.jpg	much complained of in the last Detachment.
275-13.jpg	You are to apply to Major Lewis for the In-
275-14.jpg	structions which I left with him, and see
275-15.jpg	that they are observed.
275-16.jpg	Given under my Hand Vc.

275-18.jpg	29th. 1755.
275-19.jpg	29th. To Mr. Commissary Dick
275-20.jpg	You are, so soon as you arrive here, to
275-21.jpg	give such directions as you shall see necessary about
275-22.jpg	driving the Cattle to Fort Cumberland. You are
275-23.jpg	to send up Doctor Walker, or go yourself there, to
275-24.jpg	see them killed and properly salted. Whichever of
275-25.jpg	you remains here, must purchase such a quantity
275-26.jpg	of Pork as you imagine will be necessary for the
275-27.jpg	Troops, upon the most reasonable terms you can; and
275-28.jpg	oblige them to deliver it at whatever time you shall
275-29.jpg	judge most proper. You are to answer, out of the money
275-30.jpg	in your hands, whatever Draughts Captain Hogg
275-31.jpg	may draw on you for the subsistance of his Company,
275-32.jpg	from time to time. You are to see that Coopers are
275-33.jpg	engaged to make Berrels for the Provisions, and to
276-01.jpg	276. Letters Orders and Instructions. October 1755.
276-02.jpg	provide all other necessaries for the Expedition,
276-03.jpg	which you know will be wanted
276-04.jpg	As there are several Contracts made by me to
276-05.jpg	have Cattle delivered here Vc. by the 1st. of next
276-06.jpg	month, - I desire that for such as you receive up-
276-07.jpg	on that account, if you have money in your
276-08.jpg	hands, you make immediate payment.
276-09.jpg	Given Vc.

276-16.jpg	men, the Guard to - day - Captain Peachy is
276-17.jpg	ordered to take upon him the command
276-18.jpg	of the Recruits which arrived here under

276-21.jpg	orders- Ensign Hedgeman, and the Recruits
276-22.jpg	which arrived with him, are ordered to join
276-23.jpg	Lieutenant King, and be under his command
276-24.jpg	until further orders- Lieutenant Eustace, and
276-25.jpg	the eight men with him, are to join (as soon as
276-26.jpg	they arrive at Fort Cumberland) the Company
276-27.jpg	which Captain Waggener commands at present; -
276-28.jpg	and the Party left with Sergeant Shaw, is to re-
276-29.jpg	turn to their respective Companies, so soon as
276-30.jpg	they reach the Fort - The Commissary is to see
276-31.jpg	that the Magazine is secured, by fastening
276-32.jpg	up the windows Vc. better than they now are.

277-01.jpg	Letters, Orders and Instructions. October 1755. - 277.
277-02.jpg	thed to - morrow, and to be very particular in their Accounts
277-03.jpg	of what they receive. They will also receive Arms so
277-04.jpg	soon as they arrive from Fort Cumberland, to complete their
277-05.jpg	Recruits. They are to see that each man distinguishes
277-06.jpg	his Firelock by some particular mark, which the Sub-
277-07.jpg	alterns of the Company are to enter in a Book, they are
277-08.jpg	to keep for that purpose. Every Officer is to provide an
277-09.jpg	Orderly Book to enter the Orders in as they issue every
277-10.jpg	day regularly, that they may examine them often,
277-11.jpg	and see they are duly complied with. Captain
277-12.jpg	Bronaugh, Lieutenant Stewart, Blegg and Williams,

277-17.jpg	Virginia Regiment.
277-18.jpg	You are hereby ordered, as soon as
277-19.jpg	the Clothes and Arms arrive, to furnish all the
277-20.jpg	men who now Rendezvous at Fredericksburgh,

277-22.jpg	with the utmost dispatch to Fort Cumberland,
277-23.jpg	to reinforce the Garrison. - When you arrive at
277-24.jpg	Winchester, you must provide your men with Car-
277-25.jpg	tridges. - You are to be very careful and circum-
277-26.jpg	spect in your march; and see that your men
277-27.jpg	do not on any account whatsoever, plunder or
277-28.jpg	pillage the Houses which the people have deserted,
277-29.jpg	or any others, - or Plantations. - Lieutenant Fra-
277-30.jpg	zier and Ensign Carter, are appointed to this Com-
277-31.jpg	mand
277-32.jpg	Given Vc.
277-33.jpg	G.W.
278-01.jpg	278. Letters, Orders and Instructions. October 1755.
278-02.jpg	1st. To Captain John Mercer of the
278-03.jpg	Virginia Regiment.
278-04.jpg	You are hereby ordered to Ren-
278-05.jpg	dezvous at Alexandria the first Day of
278-06.jpg	December, with all the men you can
278-07.jpg	raise by that time.
278-08.jpg	Given Vc. at Fredericksburg,
278-09.jpg	November 1st. 1755.
278-10.jpg	G.W. Aid de camp.
278-11.jpg	N.B. Captain Joshua Lewis is allowed to
278-12.jpg	the 1st. of December, to Rendezvous at Alex-
278-13.jpg	andria.
278-14.jpg	1st. To Mr. Boyd, Paymaster.
278-15.jpg	As Colonel Stephen has brought
278-16.jpg	lb1000 which I wrote for to pay off the Troops,
278-17.jpg	it will save you a journey to Williams-
278-18.jpg	burg at this time: but I think it absolutely
278-19.jpg	necessary that you should, after paying the
278-20.jpg	Troops in Garrison, go into Augusta, to pay
278-21.jpg	off Captain Hoggs Company, which is now
278-22.jpg	complete; unless you can send the money
278-23.jpg	by Mr. Mc. Clenachan, or some safe hand
278-24.jpg	from hence. The Recruits at Fort
278-25.jpg	Cumberland are all paid off to the 1st. of Oc-
278-26.jpg	tober as private men, there being no distinc-
278-27.jpg	tion made between them and Sergeants,
278-28.jpg	none having yet been regularly appointed.
278-29.jpg	Colonel Stephen will give you an ac-
278-30.jpg	count of those he has paid, and how -
278-31.jpg	If any have received Sergeants pay, it
278-32.jpg	must be deducted next payment: as also
279-01.jpg	Letters, Orders and Instructions. November 1755.279.
279-02.jpg	two - pence per month, from each non - commissioned
279-03.jpg	Officer and Soldier for purchasing medicines; -
279-04.jpg	this is to be paid to the Surgeon Quarterly. There is
279-05.jpg	also six - pence per month to be stopped from the Drum-
279-06.jpg	mers, to be paid to the Drum - Major for teaching them,
279-07.jpg	and repairing the Drums. - These deductions you are
279-08.jpg	hereby ordered to make each pay - day; unless coun-
279-09.jpg	termanded by the Governor or myself. If any non-
279-10.jpg	commissioned Officer or Soldier should happen to
279-11.jpg	die, he is to be continued on the pay roll as an ef-
279-12.jpg	fective man for twenty eight days, to pay for his
279-13.jpg	Coffin, Vc. I am Vc.
279-14.jpg	G.W.
279-15.jpg	1st. To Commissary Jones, - Or to George Conway.
279-16.jpg	You are hereby Ordered to deliver
279-17.jpg	to Sergeant Wilper (taking his receipt for the same)
279-18.jpg	for the use of Captain Hoggs Company, eight
279-19.jpg	Regimental Coats, ten Waistcoats, ten pair of
279-20.jpg	Breeches, nine Hats, eleven Shirts, as many
279-21.jpg	pair of Stockings, and the same quantity of
279-22.jpg	Shoes. - You are also to deliver to the said
279-23.jpg	Wilper, for the use of the said Company, - twelve
279-24.jpg	Musquets; twenty Bayonets, and ten Cartouch-
279-25.jpg	Box's, out of those Arms now in Store.
279-26.jpg	G.W.
279-27.jpg	N.B. The Bayonets must be delivered out of those
279-28.jpg	loose ones in the Store: You are also ordered to de-
279-29.jpg	liver twenty Blankets.
279-30.jpg	Octo. 30th. To Sergeant David Wilper, of the Virginia
279-31.jpg	Regiment.
300-01.jpg	300. Letters, Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
300-02.jpg	Hogg's Company, if any opportunity offers.
300-03.jpg	You are to be particularly ex-
300-04.jpg	act and careful in these payments: see-
300-05.jpg	ing that there is no disagreement between
300-06.jpg	the Returns, and your Pay-Rolls; as there
300-07.jpg	will be strict examination into it hereaf-
300-08.jpg	ter. I am Vc.
300-09.jpg	G.W.
300-10.jpg	Alexandria: December 3, 1755.
300-11.jpg	5th. To the Honourable Robert Dinwiddie,
300-12.jpg	Esquire; Governor.
300-13.jpg	I have sent the Bearer, Cap-
300-14.jpg	tain John Mercer (who has accompts to
300-15.jpg	settle with the Committee to the Treasu-
300-16.jpg	rer for the balance of that ten thousand
300-17.jpg	pounds; and to aquaint your Honour,
300-18.jpg	that meeting with Letters at Fredericks-
300-19.jpg	burgh, as I returned from Williamsburgh,
300-20.jpg	informing me that all was peaceable
300-21.jpg	above, and that nothing was so imme-
300-22.jpg	diately wanting as Salt. I got what I
300-23.jpg	could at that place, and hastened on
300-24.jpg	here to engage more; - to receive the Recruits
300-25.jpg	that were expected in; and to wait the ar-
300-26.jpg	rival of the Vessel with arms, Vc. from James
300-27.jpg	River, in order to forward them up with
300-28.jpg	the greater dispatch. The Vessel is not yet
300-29.jpg	arrived. -
300-30.jpg	I have impatiently expected
300-31.jpg	to hear the result of you Honours Letter
300-32.jpg	to General Shirley; and with that the de-
301-01.jpg	p. 301.
301-02.jpg	Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
301-03.jpg	lays may not prove ominous. In that case, I
301-04.jpg	shall not know how to act; for I can never
301-05.jpg	submit to the command of Captain Dag-
301-06.jpg	morthy, since you have honoured me with
301-07.jpg	the Command of the Virginia Regiment,
301-08.jpg	Vc. The Country has sustained inconceivable
301-09.jpg	losses by delaying the Commissaries at Williamsburgh:
301-10.jpg	many of the Carolina Beeves are dead, through ab-
301-11.jpg	solute poverty; and the chief part of them too poor
301-12.jpg	to slaughter. We are at a loss how to act, for want
301-13.jpg	of the mutiny Bill; and should be obliged to
301-14.jpg	your Honour to have fifty or an hundred printed,
301-15.jpg	and sent by the Bearer. There is a clause in
301-16.jpg	that Bill, which if you are not kind enough
301-17.jpg	to obviate, will prevent entirely the good inten-
301-18.jpg	tion of it: i.e. delaying the execution of Sen-
301-19.jpg	tences, until your Honour shall be made ac-
301-20.jpg	quainted with the proceedings of the Court.
301-21.jpg	This, at times when there is the great-
301-22.jpg	est occasion for Expamples, will be morally im-
301-23.jpg	possible (I mean while we are on our march;
301-24.jpg	perhaps near the Ohio) when none but strong par-
301-25.jpg	ties can pass with safety: at all times it must be
301-26.jpg	attended with great expence, trouble and inconve-
301-27.jpg	niency. this I represented to Colonel Corbin and
301-28.jpg	some other Gentlemen of the Council, when I
301-29.jpg	was down; who said that that objection to
301-30.jpg	the Bill would be removed, by your Hon-
301-31.jpg	ours giving Blank Warrants, to be filled up
301-32.jpg	as occasion should require. This would effec-
301-33.jpg	tually remedy all those Evils, and put things
301-34.jpg	in their proper channel.
301-35.jpg	We suffer greatly for want of Ket-
302-01.jpg	302. Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
302-02.jpg	Kettles: those sent from below being Tin, are of
302-03.jpg	small duration. We shall also in a little time,
302-04.jpg	suffer as much for want of Clothing; none
302-05.jpg	can be got in these parts: those which Major
302-06.jpg	Carlyle and Dalton contracted to furnish,
302-07.jpg	we are disappointed off. Shoes and Stockings
302-08.jpg	we have, and can get more if wanted, but
302-09.jpg	nothing else. I should be glad your Honor
302-10.jpg	would direct what is to be done in these ca-
302-11.jpg	ses; and that you would be kind enough to
302-12.jpg	desire the Treasurer to send some part of the
302-13.jpg	money in gold and silver: were this done, we
302-14.jpg	might often get necessaries for the Regiment
302-15.jpg	in Maryland or Pennsylvania, when they
302-16.jpg	can not be had here. but with our money
302-17.jpg	it is is impossible; our paper not passing there.
302-18.jpg	The recruiting Service goes on ex-
302-19.jpg	tremely slow. Yesterday being a day appointed
302-20.jpg	for Rendezvousing at this place, there came in
302-21.jpg	ten Officers with twenty men only. If I had
302-22.jpg	any other than paper money, and you appro-
302-23.jpg	ved of it; I would send to Pennsylvania
302-24.jpg	and the Borders of Carolina: I am confident,
302-25.jpg	men might be had there. Your Honor
302-26.jpg	never having given any particular Directi-
302-27.jpg	ons about the Provisions; I should be glad to
302-28.jpg	know, whether you would have more laid in
302-29.jpg	than what will serve for twelve hundred men;
302-30.jpg	that I may give orders accordingly.
302-31.jpg	As I can not now conceive, that
302-32.jpg	any great danger can be apprehended at
302-33.jpg	Fort Cumberland this Winter; I am sensible,
302-34.jpg	that my constant attendance there, can not
303-01.jpg	p. 303.
303-02.jpg	Letters Orders and Instructions December. 1755.
303-03.jpg	to place,
303-04.jpg	be so serviceable as riding from place making the
303-05.jpg	proper Dispositions, and seeing that all our neces-
303-06.jpg	saries are forwarded up with dispatch. I there-
303-07.jpg	fore think it advisable to inform your Honour
303-08.jpg	of it, hoping that it will correspond with your own opinion.
303-09.jpg	I forgot to mention when I was down, that Mr. Living-
303-10.jpg	ston, the Fort - Major, was appointed adjutant to our
303-11.jpg	Regiment: - I knew of none else whose long servitude
303-12.jpg	in a military way, had qualified better for the office,
303-13.jpg	he was appointed the 17th. of September.
303-14.jpg	Captain Mercer's pay, as aid de camp,
303-15.jpg	seems yet doubtful; I should be glad if your Honour
303-16.jpg	would fix it: so is Captain Stewarts: If Captain Stew-
303-17.jpg	arts is encreased, I suppose all the Officers belonging
303-18.jpg	to the Light Horse will expect to have theirs augmen-
303-19.jpg	ted also. Colonel Stephens, in a late letter, dis-
303-20.jpg	covered an inclination to go to the Creek and Che-
303-21.jpg	rokee Indians this Winter. I told him where to ap-
303-22.jpg	ply, if he had any such thoughts. I believe, on
303-23.jpg	so useful a Business, he might be spared until
303-24.jpg	the Spring. If your Honor think proper to or-
303-25.jpg	der the Act of Assembly for apprehending Deser-
303-26.jpg	ters, and against harbouring them, to be published
303-27.jpg	every Sunday in each parish Church, until the
303-28.jpg	people were made acquainted with the Law, it would
303-29.jpg	have a very good effect. The Commonalty in gene-
303-30.jpg	ral, or more through ignorance than design: few
303-31.jpg	of them are acquainted that such a Law exists: and
303-32.jpg	there is no other certain way of bringing it to their
303-33.jpg	knowledge. There are a great many of the men
303-34.jpg	that did once belong to our Companies, deserted
303-35.jpg	from the Regiments into which they were draugh-
303-36.jpg	ted, that would now gladly return if they could
304-01.jpg	304. Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
304-02.jpg	be sure of idemnity. If your Honor would
304-03.jpg	be kind enough to intimate this to General
304-04.jpg	Shirley, or the Colonels of those Regiments, - it
304-05.jpg	would be of service to us: without leave we
304-06.jpg	dare not receive them. Vc.

304-08.jpg	Alexandria: December
304-09.jpg	5th. 1755.
304-10.jpg	5th. To John Robinson Esquire, Speaker.
304-11.jpg	The Bearer, captain John Mercer,
304-12.jpg	having leave to go down and Settle his ac-
304-13.jpg	compts with the Committee; is ordered to
304-14.jpg	call upon you for the balance of the ten
304-15.jpg	thousand pounds, which I believe we shall
304-16.jpg	want before another opportunity may offer;
304-17.jpg	this being the time when our Demands for
304-18.jpg	money are greatest. When I left Willi-
304-19.jpg	amsburgh, I intended to proceed to Winches-
304-20.jpg	ter; but meeting with Letters at Fredericks-
304-21.jpg	burgh, informing me that peace prevailed
304-22.jpg	above, and that nothing was immediate-
304-23.jpg	ly wanted but Salt; I came up here to en-
304-24.jpg	gage what I could, and to wait the arrival
304-25.jpg	of some Recruits at this place; and a Vessel
304-26.jpg	with sundry arms, Vc. for the Troops. This Ves-
304-27.jpg	sel left Williamsburgh two days after I did,
304-28.jpg	and is not yet arrived: neither is the Ex-
304-29.jpg	press returned, which the Governor sent to
304-30.jpg	General Shirley for Commissions for the
304-31.jpg	Field Officers of our Regiment: which gives
304-32.jpg	me much concern; fearing that this de-
304-33.jpg	lay is ominous. In that case, I shall not
304-34.jpg	know how to act; - it will be useless for me
305-01.jpg	p.305
305-02.jpg	Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
305-03.jpg	to go to a place where I am to be commanded
305-04.jpg	and directed by another, who can have no
305-05.jpg	other pretence, than that of having a commis-
305-06.jpg	sion from the King.
305-07.jpg	We shall suffer very greatly in a little
305-08.jpg	time, for want of Clothing for the Soldiers; and none
305-09.jpg	can be had here, nor in short, I believe in the
305-10.jpg	Country. Those which Carlyle and Dalton con-
305-11.jpg	tracted to furnish, we are disappointed in; and
305-12.jpg	they say, they have searched all the Stores in
305-13.jpg	Maryland, as well as this part of Virginia, and
305-14.jpg	none are able to furnish Clothes. We have
305-15.jpg	sustained inconceivable losses by the commis-
305-16.jpg	saries delays: many of the Carolina Beeves
305-17.jpg	are dead, through poverty and bad manage-
305-18.jpg	ment; and the chief of them are too poor to
305-19.jpg	slaughter. Pray make my Compliments
305-20.jpg	to my Friends below; and believe me Vc.
305-21.jpg	G.W.
305-22.jpg	P.S. The Committee, I believe,
305-23.jpg	have not yet fixed the pay of
305-24.jpg	the Lieutenant Colonel and Major.
305-25.jpg	Pray propose it, and let me know
305-26.jpg	their Resolves.
305-27.jpg	Alexandria December 5th. 1755.
305-28.jpg	5th To Lieutenant George Frazier,
305-29.jpg	at Fredericksburgh.
305-30.jpg	As a quantity of Salt is wanted at
305-31.jpg	Fort Cumberland for curing the provisions, you
305-32.jpg	must endeavour to purchase it upon the best
