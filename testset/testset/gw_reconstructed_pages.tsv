that the men of the Virginia Regiment are exer-
cised as often every day as the duty will admit;
and that they are practised also in shooting at Tar-
gets; and if there are any who are remarkably
awkward, particular pains must be taken with
them. You must observe on your march good
order and discipline, and see that no irregu-
larities happen; and that the men are not
allowed to pillage the Country, which was very
much complained of in the last Detachment.
You are to apply to Major Lewis for the In-

that they are observed.

You are, so soon as you arrive here, to
give such directions as you shall see necessary about
driving the Cattle to Fort Cumberland. You are
to send up Doctor Walker, or go yourself there, to
see them killed and properly salted. Whichever of
you remains here, must purchase such a quantity
of Pork as you imagine will be necessary for the
Troops, upon the most reasonable terms you can; and
oblige them to deliver it at whatever time you shall
judge most proper. You are to answer, out of the money
in your hands, whatever Draughts Captain Hogg
may draw on you for the subsistance of his Company,
from time to time. You are to see that Coopers are
engaged to make Berrels for the Provisions, and to"

As Colonel Stephen has brought
lb1000 which I wrote for to pay off the Troops,
it will save you a journey to Williams-
burg at this time: but I think it absolutely
necessary that you should, after paying the
Troops in Garrison, go into Augusta, to pay
off Captain Hoggs Company, which is now
complete; unless you can send the money
by Mr. Mc. Clenachan, or some safe hand
from hence. The Recruits at Fort
Cumberland are all paid off to the 1st. of Oc-
tober as private men, there being no distinc-
tion made between them and Sergeants,
none having yet been regularly appointed.
Colonel Stephen will give you an ac-
count of those he has paid, and how -
If any have received Sergeants pay, it
must be deducted next payment: as also"

Officer and Soldier for purchasing medicines; -
this is to be paid to the Surgeon Quarterly. There is
also six - pence per month to be stopped from the Drum-

and repairing the Drums. - These deductions you are
hereby ordered to make each pay - day; unless coun-
termanded by the Governor or myself. If any non-
commissioned Officer or Soldier should happen to

fective man for twenty eight days, to pay for his

5th. To the Honourable Robert Dinwiddie,
Esquire; Governor.
I have sent the Bearer, Cap-
tain John Mercer (who has accompts to
settle with the Committee to the Treasu-
rer for the balance of that ten thousand
pounds; and to aquaint your Honour,
that meeting with Letters at Fredericks-
burgh, as I returned from Williamsburgh,
informing me that all was peaceable
above, and that nothing was so imme-
diately wanting as Salt. I got what I
could at that place, and hastened on
here to engage more; - to receive the Recruits
that were expected in; and to wait the ar-
rival of the Vessel with arms, Vc. from James
River, in order to forward them up with
the greater dispatch. The Vessel is not yet
arrived. -
I have impatiently expected
to hear the result of you Honours Letter
to General Shirley; and with that the de-"

lays may not prove ominous. In that case, I
shall not know how to act; for I can never
submit to the command of Captain Dag-
morthy, since you have honoured me with
the Command of the Virginia Regiment,
Vc. The Country has sustained inconceivable
losses by delaying the Commissaries at Williamsburgh:
many of the Carolina Beeves are dead, through ab-
solute poverty; and the chief part of them too poor
to slaughter. We are at a loss how to act, for want
of the mutiny Bill; and should be obliged to
your Honour to have fifty or an hundred printed,
and sent by the Bearer. There is a clause in
that Bill, which if you are not kind enough
to obviate, will prevent entirely the good inten-
tion of it: i.e. delaying the execution of Sen-
tences, until your Honour shall be made ac-
quainted with the proceedings of the Court.
This, at times when there is the great-
est occasion for Expamples, will be morally im-
possible (I mean while we are on our march;
perhaps near the Ohio) when none but strong par-
ties can pass with safety: at all times it must be
attended with great expence, trouble and inconve-
niency. this I represented to Colonel Corbin and
some other Gentlemen of the Council, when I
was down; who said that that objection to
the Bill would be removed, by your Hon-
ours giving Blank Warrants, to be filled up
as occasion should require. This would effec-
tually remedy all those Evils, and put things
in their proper channel.
We suffer greatly for want of Ket-"
pages/302.jpg	"302. Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
Kettles: those sent from below being Tin, are of
small duration. We shall also in a little time,
suffer as much for want of Clothing; none
can be got in these parts: those which Major
Carlyle and Dalton contracted to furnish,
we are disappointed off. Shoes and Stockings
we have, and can get more if wanted, but
nothing else. I should be glad your Honor
would direct what is to be done in these ca-
ses; and that you would be kind enough to
desire the Treasurer to send some part of the
money in gold and silver: were this done, we
might often get necessaries for the Regiment
in Maryland or Pennsylvania, when they
can not be had here. but with our money
it is is impossible; our paper not passing there.
The recruiting Service goes on ex-
tremely slow. Yesterday being a day appointed
for Rendezvousing at this place, there came in
ten Officers with twenty men only. If I had
any other than paper money, and you appro-
ved of it; I would send to Pennsylvania
and the Borders of Carolina: I am confident,
men might be had there. Your Honor
never having given any particular Directi-
ons about the Provisions; I should be glad to
know, whether you would have more laid in
than what will serve for twelve hundred men;
that I may give orders accordingly.
As I can not now conceive, that
any great danger can be apprehended at
Fort Cumberland this Winter; I am sensible,
that my constant attendance there, can not"

to place,
be so serviceable as riding from place making the
proper Dispositions, and seeing that all our neces-
saries are forwarded up with dispatch. I there-
fore think it advisable to inform your Honour
of it, hoping that it will correspond with your own opinion.
I forgot to mention when I was down, that Mr. Living-
ston, the Fort - Major, was appointed adjutant to our
Regiment: - I knew of none else whose long servitude
in a military way, had qualified better for the office,
he was appointed the 17th. of September.
Captain Mercer's pay, as aid de camp,
seems yet doubtful; I should be glad if your Honour
would fix it: so is Captain Stewarts: If Captain Stew-
arts is encreased, I suppose all the Officers belonging
to the Light Horse will expect to have theirs augmen-
ted also. Colonel Stephens, in a late letter, dis-
covered an inclination to go to the Creek and Che-
rokee Indians this Winter. I told him where to ap-
ply, if he had any such thoughts. I believe, on
so useful a Business, he might be spared until
the Spring. If your Honor think proper to or-
der the Act of Assembly for apprehending Deser-
ters, and against harbouring them, to be published
every Sunday in each parish Church, until the
people were made acquainted with the Law, it would
have a very good effect. The Commonalty in gene-
ral, or more through ignorance than design: few
of them are acquainted that such a Law exists: and
there is no other certain way of bringing it to their
knowledge. There are a great many of the men
that did once belong to our Companies, deserted
from the Regiments into which they were draugh-
ted, that would now gladly return if they could"

be sure of idemnity. If your Honor would
be kind enough to intimate this to General
Shirley, or the Colonels of those Regiments, - it
would be of service to us: without leave we
dare not receive them. Vc.

5th. To John Robinson Esquire, Speaker.
The Bearer, captain John Mercer,
having leave to go down and Settle his ac-
compts with the Committee; is ordered to
call upon you for the balance of the ten
thousand pounds, which I believe we shall
want before another opportunity may offer;
this being the time when our Demands for
money are greatest. When I left Willi-
amsburgh, I intended to proceed to Winches-
ter; but meeting with Letters at Fredericks-
burgh, informing me that peace prevailed
above, and that nothing was immediate-
ly wanted but Salt; I came up here to en-
gage what I could, and to wait the arrival
of some Recruits at this place; and a Vessel
with sundry arms, Vc. for the Troops. This Ves-
sel left Williamsburgh two days after I did,
and is not yet arrived: neither is the Ex-
press returned, which the Governor sent to
General Shirley for Commissions for the
Field Officers of our Regiment: which gives
me much concern; fearing that this de-
lay is ominous. In that case, I shall not
know how to act; - it will be useless for me"

to go to a place where I am to be commanded
and directed by another, who can have no
other pretence, than that of having a commis-
sion from the King.
We shall suffer very greatly in a little
time, for want of Clothing for the Soldiers; and none
can be had here, nor in short, I believe in the
Country. Those which Carlyle and Dalton con-
tracted to furnish, we are disappointed in; and
they say, they have searched all the Stores in
Maryland, as well as this part of Virginia, and
none are able to furnish Clothes. We have
sustained inconceivable losses by the commis-
saries delays: many of the Carolina Beeves
are dead, through poverty and bad manage-
ment; and the chief of them are too poor to
slaughter. Pray make my Compliments
to my Friends below; and believe me Vc.
