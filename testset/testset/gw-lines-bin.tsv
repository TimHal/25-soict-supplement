275-01.png	Letters, Orders and Instructions. October 1755. 275.
275-03.png	who is to go up to Fort Cumberland. You are to see
275-04.png	that the men of the Virginia Regiment are exer-
275-05.png	cised as often every day as the duty will admit;
275-06.png	and that they are practised also in shooting at Tar-
275-07.png	gets; and if there are any who are remarkably
275-08.png	awkward, particular pains must be taken with
275-09.png	them. You must observe on your march good
275-10.png	order and discipline, and see that no irregu-
275-11.png	larities happen; and that the men are not
275-12.png	allowed to pillage the Country, which was very
275-13.png	much complained of in the last Detachment.
275-14.png	You are to apply to Major Lewis for the In-
275-15.png	structions which I left with him, and see
275-16.png	that they are observed.

275-21.png	29th. To Mr. Commifsary Dick
275-22.png	You are, so soon as you arrive here, to
275-23.png	give such directions as you shall see necefsary about
275-24.png	driving the Cattle to Fort Cumberland. You are
275-25.png	to send up Doctor Walker, or go yourself there, to
275-26.png	see them killed and properly salted. Whichever of
275-27.png	you remains here, must purchase such a quantity
275-28.png	of Pork as you imagine will be necefsary for the
275-29.png	Troops, upon the most reasonable terms you can; and
275-30.png	oblige them to deliver it at whatever time you shall
275-31.png	judge most proper. You are to answer, out of the money
275-32.png	in your hands, whatever Draughts Captain Hogg
275-33.png	may draw on you for the subsistance of his Company,
275-34.png	from time to time. You are to see that Coopers are
275-35.png	engaged to make Berrels for the Provisions, and to
276-02.png	276. Letters Orders and Instructions. October 1755.
276-04.png	provide all other necefsaries for the Expedition,
276-05.png	which you know will be wanted
276-06.png	As there are several Contracts made by me to
276-07.png	have Cattle delivered here c. by the 1st. of next
276-08.png	month, - I desire that for such as you receive up-
276-09.png	on that account, if you have money in your
276-10.png	hands, you make immediate payment.

276-20.png	ordered to take upon him the command

276-24.png	orders- Ensign Hedgeman, and the Recruits
276-25.png	which arrived with him, are ordered to join

276-28.png	the eight men with him, are to join as soon as
276-29.png	they arrive at Fort Cumberland the Company
276-30.png	which Captain Waggener commands at present; -
276-31.png	and the Party left with Sergeant Shaw, is to re-

276-33.png	they reach the Fort - The Commifsary is to see
276-34.png	that the Magazine is secured, by fastening
276-35.png	up the windows c. better than they now are.

277-02.png	Letters, Orders and Instructions. October 1755. - 277.
277-04.png	thed to - morrow, and to be very particular in their Accounts
277-05.png	of what they receive. They will also receive Arms so
277-06.png	soon as they arrive from Fort Cumberland, to complete their
277-07.png	Recruits. They are to see that each man distinguishes
277-08.png	his Firelock by some particular mark, which the Sub-
277-09.png	alterns of the Company are to enter in a Book, they are
277-10.png	to keep for that purpose. Every Officer is to provide an
277-11.png	Orderly Book to enter the Orders in as they ifsue every
277-12.png	day regularly, that they may examine them often,
277-13.png	and see they are duly complied with. Captain

277-21.png	You are hereby ordered, as soon as

277-30.png	do not on any account whatsoever, plunder or

277-32.png	or any others, - or Plantations. - Lieutenant Fra-
277-33.png	zier and Ensign Carter, are appointed to this Com-

278-01.png	278. Letters, Orders and Instructions. October 1755.
278-03.png	1st. To Captain John Mercer of the
278-04.png	Virginia Regiment.
278-05.png	You are hereby ordered to Ren-
278-06.png	dezvous at Alexandria the first Day of
278-07.png	December, with all the men you can
278-08.png	raise by that time.
278-09.png	Given c. at Fredericksburg,
278-10.png	November 1st. 1755.
278-11.png	G.W. Aid de camp.
278-13.png	N.B. Captain Joshua Lewis is allowed to
278-14.png	the 1st. of December, to Rendezvous at Alex-
278-15.png	andria.
278-17.png	1st. To Mr. Boyd, Paymaster.
278-18.png	As Colonel Stephen has brought
278-19.png	1000 which I wrote for to pay off the Troops,
278-20.png	it will save you a journey to Williams-
278-21.png	burg at this time: but I think it absolutely
278-22.png	necefsary that you should, after paying the
278-23.png	Troops in Garrison, go into Augusta, to pay
278-24.png	off Captain Hoggs Company, which is now
278-25.png	complete; unlefs you can send the money
278-26.png	by Mr. Mc. Clenachan, or some safe hand
278-27.png	from hence. The Recruits at Fort
278-28.png	Cumberland are all paid off to the 1st. of Oc-
278-29.png	tober as private men, there being no distinc-
278-30.png	tion made between them and Sergeants,
278-31.png	none having yet been regularly appointed.
278-32.png	Colonel Stephen will give you an ac-
278-33.png	count of those he has paid, and how -
278-34.png	If any have received Sergeants pay, it
278-35.png	must be deducted next payment: as also
279-01.png	Letters, Orders and Instructions. November 1755.279.
279-03.png	two - pence per month, from each non - commifsioned
279-04.png	Officer and Soldier for purchasing medicines; -
279-05.png	this is to be paid to the Surgeon Quarterly. There is
279-06.png	also six - pence per month to be stopped from the Drum-
279-07.png	mers, to be paid to the Drum - Major for teaching them,
279-08.png	and repairing the Drums. - These deductions you are
279-09.png	hereby ordered to make each pay - day; unlefs coun-
279-10.png	termanded by the Governor or myself. If any non-
279-11.png	commifsioned Officer or Soldier should happen to
279-12.png	die, he is to be continued on the pay roll as an ef-
279-13.png	fective man for twenty eight days, to pay for his
279-14.png	Coffin, c. I am c.
279-16.png	1st. To Commifsary Jones, - Or to George Conway.
279-17.png	You are hereby Ordered to deliver
279-18.png	to Sergeant Wilper taking his receipt for the same
279-19.png	for the use of Captain Hoggs Company, eight
279-20.png	Regimental Coats, ten Waistcoats, ten pair of
279-21.png	Breeches, nine Hats, eleven Shirts, as many
279-22.png	pair of Stockings, and the same quantity of
279-23.png	Shoes. - You are also to deliver to the said
279-24.png	Wilper, for the use of the said Company, - twelve
279-25.png	Musquets; twenty Bayonets, and ten Cartouch-
279-26.png	Box's, out of those Arms now in Store.
279-27.png	G.W.
279-28.png	N.B. The Bayonets must be delivered out of those
279-29.png	loose ones in the Store: You are also ordered to de-
279-30.png	liver twenty Blankets.
279-32.png	Octo. 30th. To Sergeant David Wilper, of the Virginia
279-33.png	Regiment.
300-02.png	300. Letters, Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
300-04.png	Hogg's Company, if any opportunity offers.
300-05.png	You are to be particularly ex-
300-06.png	act and careful in these payments: see-
300-07.png	ing that there is no disagreement between
300-08.png	the Returns, and your Pay-Rolls; as there
300-09.png	will be strict examination into it hereaf-
300-10.png	ter. I am c.
300-11.png	G.W.
300-12.png	Alexandria: December 3, 1755.
300-14.png	5th. To the Honourable Robert Dinwiddie,
300-15.png	Esquire; Governor.
300-16.png	I have sent the Bearer, Cap-
300-17.png	tain John Mercer who has accompts to
300-18.png	settle with the Committee to the Treasu-
300-19.png	rer for the balance of that ten thousand
300-20.png	pounds; and to aquaint your Honour,
300-21.png	that meeting with Letters at Fredericks-
300-22.png	burgh, as I returned from Williamsburgh,
300-23.png	informing me that all was peaceable
300-24.png	above, and that nothing was so imme-
300-25.png	diately wanting as Salt. I got what I
300-26.png	could at that place, and hastened on
300-27.png	here to engage more; - to receive the Recruits
300-28.png	that were expected in; and to wait the ar-
300-29.png	rival of the Vefsel with arms, c. from James
300-30.png	River, in order to forward them up with
300-31.png	the greater dispatch. The Vefsel is not yet
300-32.png	arrived. -
300-33.png	I have impatiently expected
300-34.png	to hear the result of you Honours Letter
300-35.png	to General Shirley; and with that the de-
301-03.png	Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
301-05.png	lays may not prove ominous. In that case, I
301-06.png	shall not know how to act; for I can never
301-07.png	submit to the command of Captain Dag-
301-08.png	morthy, since you have honoured me with
301-09.png	the Command of the Virginia Regiment,
301-10.png	c. The Country has sustained inconceivable
301-11.png	lofses by delaying the Commifsaries at Williamsburgh:
301-12.png	many of the Carolina Beeves are dead, through ab-
301-13.png	solute poverty; and the chief part of them too poor
301-14.png	to slaughter. We are at a lofs how to act, for want
301-15.png	of the mutiny Bill; and should be obliged to
301-16.png	your Honour to have fifty or an hundred printed,
301-17.png	and sent by the Bearer. There is a clause in
301-18.png	that Bill, which if you are not kind enough
301-19.png	to obviate, will prevent entirely the good inten-
301-20.png	tion of it: i.e. delaying the execution of Sen-
301-21.png	tences, until your Honour shall be made ac-
301-22.png	quainted with the proceedings of the Court.
301-23.png	This, at times when there is the great-
301-24.png	est occasion for Expamples, will be morally im-
301-25.png	pofsible I mean while we are on our march;
301-26.png	perhaps near the Ohio when none but strong par-
301-27.png	ties can pafs with safety: at all times it must be
301-28.png	attended with great expence, trouble and inconve-
301-29.png	niency. this I represented to Colonel Corbin and
301-30.png	some other Gentlemen of the Council, when I
301-31.png	was down; who said that that objection to
301-32.png	the Bill would be removed, by your Hon-
301-33.png	ours giving Blank Warrants, to be filled up
301-34.png	as occasion should require. This would effec-
301-35.png	tually remedy all those Evils, and put things
301-36.png	in their proper channel.
301-37.png	We suffer greatly for want of Ket-
302-01.png	302. Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
302-03.png	Kettles: those sent from below being Tin, are of
302-04.png	small duration. We shall also in a little time,
302-05.png	suffer as much for want of Clothing; none
302-06.png	can be got in these parts: those which Major
302-07.png	Carlyle and Dalton contracted to furnish,
302-08.png	we are disappointed off. Shoes and Stockings
302-09.png	we have, and can get more if wanted, but
302-10.png	nothing else. I should be glad your Honor
302-11.png	would direct what is to be done in these ca-
302-12.png	ses; and that you would be kind enough to
302-13.png	desire the Treasurer to send some part of the
302-14.png	money in gold and silver: were this done, we
302-15.png	might often get necefsaries for the Regiment
302-16.png	in Maryland or Pennsylvania, when they
302-17.png	can not be had here. but with our money
302-18.png	it is is impofsible; our paper not pafsing there.
302-19.png	The recruiting Service goes on ex-
302-20.png	tremely slow. Yesterday being a day appointed
302-21.png	for Rendezvousing at this place, there came in
302-22.png	ten Officers with twenty men only. If I had
302-23.png	any other than paper money, and you appro-
302-24.png	ved of it; I would send to Pennsylvania
302-25.png	and the Borders of Carolina: I am confident,
302-26.png	men might be had there. Your Honor
302-27.png	never having given any particular Directi-
302-28.png	ons about the Provisions; I should be glad to
302-29.png	know, whether you would have more laid in
302-30.png	than what will serve for twelve hundred men;
302-31.png	that I may give orders accordingly.
302-32.png	As I can not now conceive, that
302-33.png	any great danger can be apprehended at
302-34.png	Fort Cumberland this Winter; I am sensible,
302-35.png	that my constant attendance there, can not
303-02.png	Letters Orders and Instructions December. 1755.
303-04.png	be so serviceable as riding from place making the
303-05.png	proper Dispositions, and seeing that all our necef-
303-06.png	saries are forwarded up with dispatch. I there-
303-07.png	fore think it advisable to inform your Honour
303-08.png	of it, hoping that it will correspond with your own opinion.
303-09.png	I forgot to mention when I was down, that Mr. Living-
303-10.png	ston, the Fort - Major, was appointed adjutant to our
303-11.png	Regiment: - I knew of none else whose long servitude
303-12.png	in a military way, had qualified better for the office,
303-13.png	he was appointed the 17th. of September.
303-14.png	Captain Mercer's pay, as aid de camp,
303-15.png	seems yet doubtful; I should be glad if your Honour
303-16.png	would fix it: so is Captain Stewarts: If Captain Stew-
303-17.png	arts is encreased, I suppose all the Officers belonging
303-18.png	to the Light Horse will expect to have theirs augmen-
303-19.png	ted also. Colonel Stephens, in a late letter, dis-
303-20.png	covered an inclination to go to the Creek and Che-
303-21.png	rokee Indians this Winter. I told him where to ap-
303-22.png	ply, if he had any such thoughts. I believe, on
303-23.png	so useful a Businefs, he might be spared until
303-24.png	the Spring. If your Honor think proper to or-
303-25.png	der the Act of Afsembly for apprehending Deser-
303-26.png	ters, and against harbouring them, to be published
303-27.png	every Sunday in each parish Church, until the
303-28.png	people were made acquainted with the Law, it would
303-29.png	have a very good effect. The Commonalty in gene-
303-30.png	ral, or more through ignorance than design: few
303-31.png	of them are acquainted that such a Law exists: and
303-32.png	there is no other certain way of bringing it to their
303-33.png	knowledge. There are a great many of the men
303-34.png	that did once belong to our Companies, deserted
303-35.png	from the Regiments into which they were draugh-
303-36.png	ted, that would now gladly return if they could
304-01.png	304. Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
304-03.png	be sure of idemnity. If your Honor would
304-04.png	be kind enough to intimate this to General
304-05.png	Shirley, or the Colonels of those Regiments, - it
304-06.png	would be of service to us: without leave we
304-07.png	dare not receive them. c.
304-08.png	G.W.
304-09.png	Alexandria: December
304-10.png	5th. 1755.
304-11.png	5th. To John Robinson Esquire, Speaker.
304-12.png	The Bearer, captain John Mercer,
304-13.png	having leave to go down and Settle his ac-
304-14.png	compts with the Committee; is ordered to
304-15.png	call upon you for the balance of the ten
304-16.png	thousand pounds, which I believe we shall
304-17.png	want before another opportunity may offer;
304-18.png	this being the time when our Demands for
304-19.png	money are greatest. When I left Willi-
304-20.png	amsburgh, I intended to proceed to Winches-
304-21.png	ter; but meeting with Letters at Fredericks-
304-22.png	burgh, informing me that peace prevailed
304-23.png	above, and that nothing was immediate-
304-24.png	ly wanted but Salt; I came up here to en-
304-25.png	gage what I could, and to wait the arrival
304-26.png	of some Recruits at this place; and a Vefsel
304-27.png	with sundry arms, c. for the Troops. This Vef-
304-28.png	sel left Williamsburgh two days after I did,
304-29.png	and is not yet arrived: neither is the Ex-
304-30.png	prefs returned, which the Governor sent to
304-31.png	General Shirley for Commifsions for the
304-32.png	Field Officers of our Regiment: which gives
304-33.png	me much concern; fearing that this de-
304-34.png	lay is ominous. In that case, I shall not
304-35.png	know how to act; - it will be uselefs for me
305-01.png	p.305
305-02.png	Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
305-04.png	to go to a place where I am to be commanded
305-05.png	and directed by another, who can have no
305-06.png	other pretence, than that of having a commif-
305-07.png	sion from the King.
305-08.png	We shall suffer very greatly in a little
305-09.png	time, for want of Clothing for the Soldiers; and none
305-10.png	can be had here, nor in short, I believe in the
305-11.png	Country. Those which Carlyle and Dalton con-
305-12.png	tracted to furnish, we are disappointed in; and
305-13.png	they say, they have searched all the Stores in
305-14.png	Maryland, as well as this part of Virginia, and
305-15.png	none are able to furnish Clothes. We have
305-16.png	sustained inconceivable lofses by the commif-
305-17.png	saries delays: many of the Carolina Beeves
305-18.png	are dead, through poverty and bad manage-
305-19.png	ment; and the chief of them are too poor to
305-20.png	slaughter. Pray make my Compliments
305-21.png	to my Friends below; and believe me c.
305-22.png	G.W.
305-23.png	P.S. The Committee, I believe,
305-24.png	have not yet fixed the pay of
305-25.png	the Lieutenant Colonel and Major.
305-26.png	Pray propose it, and let me know
305-27.png	their Resolves.
305-28.png	Alexandria December 5th. 1755.
305-30.png	5th To Lieutenant George Frazier,
305-31.png	at Fredericksburgh.
305-32.png	As a quantity of Salt is wanted at
305-33.png	Fort Cumberland for curing the provisions, you
305-34.png	must endeavour to purchase it upon the best
305-35.png	terms you can; and I shall fulfil any contract
